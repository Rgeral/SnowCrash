# SnowCrash

## Welcome to SnowCrash, 

This is our inaugural cybersecurity project aimed at exploring various aspects of security challenges and solutions. SnowCrash is designed as a captivating capture the flag (CTF) challenge, presenting 15 levels of progressively challenging tasks, each designed to test your skills and knowledge in the realm of cybersecurity.<br>
I made this project in collaboration with <a href= "https://github.com/kbarbry" >@kbarbry</a>

## Project Overview

SnowCrash is a collaborative effort between two aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts, developed over a period of two weeks. With a focus on practical learning and hands-on experience, SnowCrash offers a unique opportunity to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity and hone your skills in a real-world environment.

## Learning Outcomes

SnowCrash is more than just a series of challenges; it's a journey of growth and discovery. Throughout the project, participants will have the opportunity to:

- Gain a deep understanding of Linux environments and command-line interfaces.
- Explore the intricacies of reverse engineering using tools like Ghidra.
- Learn encryption and decryption techniques for handling hashes and secure data.
- Master the art of exploiting vulnerabilities, including command injections and web security flaws.
- Analyze network traffic patterns and troubleshoot issues using tools like Wireshark.
- Delve into the complexities of session management, password handling, and user privileges.
- Uncover the nuances of CRON jobs and Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks.
- Gain familiarity with Assembly code and its role in low-level programming.
- Develop practical Python scripting skills for automation and task execution.
